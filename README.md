# Simple Chat app.

#### A simple chat app where you can talk to anybody live at that instance.

#### Basically its just a web-socket connected to a minimal chat UI made in React.

#### Also I didn't use any database to store the chats, sessions.

### Features:
<li>Only 1 Session for all for everyone online.
<li>You can talk to anybody those who are online at that time.
<li>There's only one temporary UserId is created to separate your messages from others.
<li>Just a refresh will delete all the chats on your device.

#### If still wanna try goto the below link:

<li> Host Server takes some time to start so wait for 10-20 seconds.
